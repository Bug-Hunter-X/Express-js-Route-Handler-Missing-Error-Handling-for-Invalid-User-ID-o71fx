# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The example focuses on a route that fetches a user by ID.  The original code lacks proper handling for cases where the user ID is not a valid integer, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
